## Project Purpose:

This game was built as the "Readables"  project for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of how Redux works in a React-based content and comment web app. Users can post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, edit and delete posts and comments and vote on posts and comments.

## How to Load the App
You can run a hosted version of the app at ***TO BE ADDED***

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter.  If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
```
git clone https://github.com/sarah-maris/reactnd-project-readable.git
npm install
```
Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
